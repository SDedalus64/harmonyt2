## **‚úÖ Best Practices**

- **Use clear legal references** (Section 301, Section 232, IEEPA).
- **Include date ranges or context** if temporary (e.g., ‚ÄúIEEPA May‚ÄìAug 2025‚Äù).
- Where systems don‚Äôt allow for multiple surcharge lines, a **summary statement** or **footnote** is sometimes used to explain duty composition.
