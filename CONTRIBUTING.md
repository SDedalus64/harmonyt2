Thank you for contributing to HarmonyTi! This guide will help you understand our development workflow and standards.

## üìù Changelog Updates (REQUIRED)

**Every pull request that introduces user-facing changes MUST update the CHANGELOG.md file.**

### When to Update the Changelog

Update the changelog when you:

- Add new features
- Change existing functionality
- Fix bugs
- Remove features
- Make performance improvements
- Address security issues

### How to Update the Changelog

1. Open `CHANGELOG.md` in the root directory
2. Add your changes under the `[Unreleased]` section
3. Use the appropriate category:
   - `Added` - for new features
   - `Changed` - for changes in existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` - for soon-to-be removed features
   - `Removed` - for now removed features
   - `Fixed` - for any bug fixes
   - `Security` - in case of vulnerabilities
   - `Performance` - for performance improvements

4. Write clear, concise bullet points that users can understand

### Example Changelog Entry

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Export functionality for duty calculations to PDF format
- Batch lookup feature for multiple HTS codes

### Fixed

- Country dropdown not showing all available countries
- Unit cost calculations rounding incorrectly for large quantities
```

### AI Assistance for Changelog Updates

For help writing changelog entries:

1. **Before committing**, review your changes:

   ```bash
   git diff --cached --name-only
   ```

2. **Ask an AI assistant**: "Please review these changes and update CHANGELOG.md"

3. **Review and edit** the AI's suggestions before committing

4. **Commit both** your code and the changelog together

**Note**: A pre-commit hook will remind you if you forget to update the changelog!

## üöÄ Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add tests if applicable

3. **Update the changelog**

   ```bash
   # Edit CHANGELOG.md and add your changes under [Unreleased]
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add export functionality for duty calculations

   - Added PDF export button to results screen
   - Implemented PDF generation service
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
