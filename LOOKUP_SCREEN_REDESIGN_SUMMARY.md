# LookupScreen Redesign Summary

## Overview
The LookupScreen has been redesigned according to the specified coordinates for an iPhone screen (595px wide by 1340px tall in portrait mode).

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Header Container (X0/Y0 to X595/Y236)
- Created a fixed header container at the top of the screen with exact dimensions: 595px width Ã— 236px height
- The header contains:
  - Logo section with dark navy background (100px height)
  - Entry Hub section with form fields
  - Positioned absolutely at top: 0, left: 0

### 2. Layout Structure
- **Logo Section**: 
  - Dark navy background with white Harmony logo
  - Menu buttons positioned on the right side
  - Height: 100px

- **Entry Hub Section**:
  - Contains all input fields
  - HTS Code and Country dropdowns in the same row
  - Declared Value and Units fields in the second row
  - Calculate and Clear buttons at the bottom
  - Total height allocation within the 236px header

### 3. Results Display
- Results are now displayed **inline below the entry fields** instead of in a drawer
- Scrollable content area starts at Y236 (below the fixed header)
- Results section includes:
  - Results header with country name and description
  - Duties & Fees card
  - Duty breakdown
  - Processing fees
  - Unit calculations
  - Tariff Engineering button

### 4. Removed Components
- Removed the results drawer (`resultsDrawerVisible` state)
- Removed `renderResultsDrawerContent` function
- Removed `handleCloseResultsDrawer` function
- Results are now always visible inline when available

### 5. Styling Updates
- Added new styles for the fixed header container
- Added styles for inline results display
- Updated button styles to fit within the compact header
- Maintained responsive design for different screen sizes

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- Results appear immediately below the entry form
- No need to open/close a drawer to see results
- Smoother workflow with everything visible on one screen
- Auto-scroll to results when calculation completes

## Technical Implementation
- Used absolute positioning for the fixed header
- Implemented ScrollView starting at Y236 for content below header
- Maintained all existing functionality (HTS search, country selection, calculations)
- Preserved all drawer functionality for other features (History, Settings, etc.)

## Next Steps
If you need any adjustments to the layout or want to specify coordinates for additional containers, please provide the details and I'll implement them accordingly.
