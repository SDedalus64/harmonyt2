# Commit Message Guidelines

Use commit messages that briefly describe what changed. The first line should be a short, imperative sentence that makes it clear what the commit does.

## Examples

- `Remove unused TypeScript preset`
- `Update README introduction`
- `Fix login screen layout on Android`

Avoid vague messages like `Applying previous commit` or `Fix stuff`.

Reference issues or pull requests in the body if necessary, but keep the summary line focused on the change itself.
