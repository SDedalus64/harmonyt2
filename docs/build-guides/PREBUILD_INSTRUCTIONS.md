# HarmonyTi Prebuild Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for performing a clean prebuild of the HarmonyTi app. Follow these steps exactly to ensure a successful build without warnings or errors.

## Prerequisites
- Xcode installed (latest stable version)
- Node.js and npm installed
- CocoaPods installed (`sudo gem install cocoapods`)
- All changes committed to git (recommended)

## Prerequisites - One-Time Environment Setup
Before you run **any** of the pre-build steps below, make sure your macOS environment is ready. You normally do this once per machine.

1. **Install Xcode** (from the Mac App Store or https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and launch it once to accept the licence:
   ```bash
   # opens Xcode; you may be prompted to accept the licence
   open -a Xcode
   ```
2. **Install Xcode Command-Line Tools** (required by Homebrew, CocoaPods, etc.):
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install   # only if they are not already installed
   ```
3. **Install Homebrew** (skip if already installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   brew update
   ```
4. **Install Node + npm** (use the LTS version):
   ```bash
   brew install node   # or use nvm if you prefer
   node -v             # verify
   npm -v
   ```
5. **Install CocoaPods** (Ruby gem):
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   pod --version        # verify
   ```
6. **Prepare your Git workspace** â€“ commit or stash any outstanding changes before running the pre-build process:
   ```bash
   git status           # make sure the working tree is clean
   ```

> Once the above are in place, proceed to the **Step-by-Step Prebuild Process** below every time you need a fresh native project.

## Step-by-Step Prebuild Process

### 1. Close Xcode
**CRITICAL**: Make sure Xcode is completely closed before starting
```bash
# Verify Xcode is not running
ps aux | grep Xcode
```

### 2. Clean Previous Builds
```bash
# Remove old native directories and # Clear all caches
rm -rf ios android
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-*
rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-*
rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-*
```

### 3. Install JavaScript Dependencies & Verify Metro Config (NEW)
Before touching any native code, make sure all JS dependencies are installed **and** that Metro is configured correctly.
```bash
# Install / update node modules (use `yarn` if you prefer)
npm install

# QUICK CHECK â€‘ Metro config should load without errors and report SVG support
Run:
node -e "const cfg=require('./metro.config');\
  console.log('âœ… Metro config loaded from expo/metro-config');\
  console.log('   SVG enabled:', cfg.resolver.sourceExts.includes('svg'));"
```
If you see a *MODULE_NOT_FOUND* error for `react-native-svg-transformer`, install it:
```bash
npm install --save-dev react-native-svg-transformer
```
> The check above prevents the `Serializer did not return expected format` error during native builds.

### 4. Install CocoaPods Dependencies (NEW)
After cleaning, install or update iOS pods **before** running the Expo prebuild so that the native project is created with all required pods in place.
```bash
# From the project root
npx pod-install ios
```

> This step downloads and links all native iOS dependencies declared in `package.json`. It is safe to re-run at any time.

### 5. Run Prebuild
```bash
# Generate /ios and /android native projects (non-interactive)
EXPO_NO_INTERACTIVE=1 npx expo prebuild --platform ios --no-install

# Restore the tracked Podfile after prebuild
git checkout ios/Podfile

cd ios
pod install
# If you see "directory not empty" errors, use:
rm -rf ios android && npx expo prebuild --clean
```

### 6. Run the Fix Script (CRITICAL STEP!)
**This is the most important step that fixes all Xcode warnings and permissions**
```bash
# Make the script executable (only needed once)
cd ..
chmod +x fix-xcode-warnings.sh

# Run the fix script
./fix-xcode-warnings.sh
```

Wait for the script to complete. You should see:
- âœ… Done! Common warning fixes applied.

### 7. Fix Sandbox Permissions
```bash
# Ensure expo configure script is executable
chmod +x "ios/Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-HarmonyTi/expo-configure-project.sh"
```

### 8. Open in Xcode
```bash
# Open the workspace (NOT the .xcodeproj)
cd ios
open ios/HarmonyTi.xcworkspace
```

### 9. Xcode Setup
1. **Wait for indexing** to complete (progress bar at top)
2. **Clean Build Folder**: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. **Select Team**:
   - Click on HarmonyTi in the project navigator
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Select your development team
4. **Handle Dialogs**:
   - If asked about "uncommitted changes", click "Continue"
   - If asked about "recommended settings", click "Perform Changes"

### 10. Build and Archive
1. **Select Device**: Choose "Any iOS Device (arm64)" from the device selector
2. **Archive**: Product â†’ Archive
3. **Wait**: The build process may take 5-10 minutes
4. **Distribute**: Once archived, click "Distribute App" â†’ "App Store Connect"

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Sandbox: bash deny file-read-data"
**Solution**: Already fixed by step 5, but if it persists:
```bash
cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install
```

### Issue: Build fails with signing errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're logged into Xcode with your Apple ID
- Check that your provisioning profiles are up to date
- Try: Xcode â†’ Settings â†’ Accounts â†’ Download Manual Profiles

### Issue: Metro bundler errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Kill any running Metro processes
killall -9 node
# Clear watchman
watchman watch-del-all
# Start fresh
npx expo start --clear
```

### Quick Commands: Port 8081 In Use
```bash
lsof -i :8081
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :8081)
npm start
```

### Issue: Pod installation fails
**Solution**:
```bash
cd ios
pod repo update
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
```

## Checklist Before Building

- [ ] Xcode is closed before starting
- [ ] Git changes are committed (recommended)
- [ ] Removed old ios/android directories
- [ ] Ran `npx expo prebuild --clean`
- [ ] **Ran `./fix-xcode-warnings.sh` script**
- [ ] Fixed sandbox permissions
- [ ] Opened .xcworkspace (not .xcodeproj)
- [ ] Selected development team
- [ ] Cleaned build folder in Xcode
- [ ] Selected "Any iOS Device (arm64)"

## Build Numbers
Remember to increment build numbers before archiving:
```bash
# Automatic increment
npm run bump

# Or manual increment in app.json:
# iOS: "buildNumber"
# Android: "versionCode"
```

## For CI/CD or Automated Builds

Create a script `prebuild-complete.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "ðŸš€ Starting complete prebuild process..."

# 1. Clean
rm -rf ios android
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# 2. Prebuild
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 3. Fix warnings (CRITICAL!)
./fix-xcode-warnings.sh

# 4. Fix permissions
chmod +x "ios/Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-HarmonyTi/expo-configure-project.sh"

echo "âœ… Prebuild complete! Open ios/HarmonyTi.xcworkspace in Xcode"
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x prebuild-complete.sh`
Then just run: `./prebuild-complete.sh`

## Important Notes

1. **Always run the fix script** - This is the most critical step that resolves 90% of build issues
2. **Use the workspace** - Always open .xcworkspace, never .xcodeproj
3. **Be patient** - Let Xcode fully index before building
4. **Commit first** - Always commit your changes before prebuild in case you need to revert

## Support

If you encounter issues not covered here:
1. Check the Expo documentation
2. Run `expo doctor` to diagnose issues
3. Check the React Native upgrade helper
4. Review recent changes in git log
