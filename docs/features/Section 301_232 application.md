Here is a detailed breakdown of **Section 301** and **Section 232** tariffs, focusing on:

- How they interact with the general HTS duty rate (stacking),
- What determines their applicability, and
- Other specifics that impact **total duty calculations**.

## **üá∫üá∏**

## **Section 301 Tariffs (China-Specific Trade Action)**

### **1.**

### **Are Section 301 tariffs stacked on top of HTS general rates?**

**Yes.**

Section 301 tariffs are **additional duties**, imposed **on top of** the base HTS rate.

- For example:
  - If base duty under HTS is 5%
  - And Section 301 adds 25%
  - **Total duty = 30%**

These appear in the HTS schedule as **additional tariff lines** (e.g., 9903.88.xx) associated with the main HTS code.

---

### **2.**

### **What determines if and how Section 301 is applied?**

- **Country of origin** must be **China**.

- **Product must appear on one of four lists** issued by the USTR:

  #### **üîπ The Four Lists (a.k.a. Tranches):**

| **List** | **Effective Date** | **Estimated Value** | **Additional Tariff**   | **HTS Chapters Impacted**             |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| List 1   | July 6, 2018       | ~$34B               | 25%                     | Ch. 84‚Äì85 (machinery, tech)           |
| List 2   | Aug 23, 2018       | ~$16B               | 25%                     | Ch. 84‚Äì90 (industrial goods)          |
| List 3   | Sept 24, 2018      | ~$200B              | Initially 10%, then 25% | Broad (furniture, foods, chemicals)   |
| List 4A  | Sept 1, 2019       | ~$120B              | 15% ‚Üí reduced to 7.5%   | Consumer goods (apparel, electronics) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **List 4B was proposed but never implemented.**

- **Importers must classify** the product by its 10-digit HTS number and **cross-reference with USTR lists**.
- Many products have **temporary exclusions**, which can eliminate or suspend the additional duty.

---

### **3.**

### **Other specifics that affect duty calculation**

- **9903.88.xx** designations in HTS:
  - Each corresponds to a specific list and duty rate.
  - Example: 9903.88.01 = List 1, 25% duty.

- **Duty is applied before MPF/HTS fees**:
  - Customs adds 301 duty **after base HTS is calculated** but **before** calculating fees like the **Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF)**.

- **Exclusion handling**:
  - Excluded items revert to **normal HTS duty only**, even if classified under a listed code.
  - Importers must **claim exclusion** at the time of entry using special provisions like 9903.88.06.

- **Country of export vs. origin**:
  - **Only country of origin matters.** Transshipping via a third country doesn‚Äôt eliminate liability.

## **üèóÔ∏è**

## **Section 232 Tariffs (National Security ‚Äì Steel & Aluminum)**

### **1.**

### **Are Section 232 tariffs stacked on top of HTS general rates?**

**Yes.**

Section 232 tariffs are **additional** to regular HTS duties.

- For example:
  - HTS duty = 3%
  - Section 232 steel duty = 25%
  - **Total = 28%**

These are tracked using **HTS overlay codes** like 9903.80.01.

---

### **2.**

### **What determines if and how Section 232 is applied?**

- **Commodity-based**, not country-specific (originally).

- Applies to **iron, steel, and aluminum** products based on the base HTS code.

- Initially imposed **globally** (March 2018), but:
  - Some countries later received **quota agreements or exclusions**.
  - Others (e.g., China) are still subject to full duties.

#### **‚öôÔ∏è Steel 232 Product Scope:**

- HTS Chapters: **72, 73**, and portions of **76**

- Example codes:
  - 7214.20.00.00 ‚Äì Hot-rolled bars
  - 7306.30.50.50 ‚Äì Welded steel pipes

- Steel = 25%, Aluminum = 10% (base)

- **HTS overlay** for 232 = 9903.80.xx

---

### **3.**

### **Other specifics that affect duty calculation**

- **Declared via HTS overlays** (e.g., 9903.80.01)

- Stacked after base HTS but **before MPF, HMF**, etc.

- **Quota countries (like Brazil)**: Duties don‚Äôt apply, but tight volume caps exist

- **Product exclusions** are granted by BIS (Dept. of Commerce), not USTR
  - These must be **pre-approved** and linked by **product + importer**

- **Country-specific product exclusions** require detailed declarations in ACE (Customs entry system)

Would you like a tool or spreadsheet to calculate total duties with both base HTS + 301 + 232 overlays and exemptions? Or do you want a specific HTS code traced through all applicable layers?
