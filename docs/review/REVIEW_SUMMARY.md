## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Merge any unique content from duplicate files into their main counterparts
   - Delete pure duplicates after verification

2. **Documentation Cleanup**:
   - Create a single CHANGELOG.md in the root if you want to maintain version history
   - Move completed feature descriptions to user documentation if relevant
   - Archive old build notes

3. **Long-term**:
   - Consider using a more structured approach for version documentation
   - Implement a clear archival policy (e.g., move to archive after 6 months)
   - Use consistent naming conventions for feature documentation
