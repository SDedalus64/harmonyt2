🚀 SIMULATOR TEST - AZURE-ONLY IMPLEMENTATION

STEP 1: Start Expo Server
npx expo start --clear

STEP 2: Launch iOS Simulator
npx expo run:ios

STEP 3: Run Performance Test Script
node scripts/performance-test.js

STEP 4: Test Sequence
1. App Startup (should be <1 second)
2. First Lookup: HTS 84715001, China, $1000
3. Cached Lookup: HTS 61091000, Mexico, $500
4. Test new drawer UI (tap FABs)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
✅ App starts instantly (no preloading)
✅ First lookup: 1-3 seconds with Azure logs
✅ Cached lookup: <500ms
✅ New elegant drawer UI works
✅ 50MB+ smaller bundle size

CONSOLE LOGS TO WATCH:
