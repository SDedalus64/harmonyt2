## New Features and Fixes

### 1. Fixed SettingsProvider Error

- Added SettingsProvider to the App component tree in App.tsx

- Resolved the error: "useSettings must be used within a SettingsProvider"

- Now the settings functionality works properly throughout the app

### 2. Removed Reciprocal Tariff Toggle

- Removed the "Make Reciprocal Tariffs Additive" toggle from the Lookup screen

- Reciprocal tariffs are now always treated as additive when they apply

- Simplified the user interface and calculation logic

- Updated both the UI (LookupScreen.tsx) and the calculation logic (tariffService.ts and useTariff.ts)

### 3. Updated Brand Color Styling

- Placeholder Text: Changed all placeholder text colors to light blue (electricBlue: #0099FF):

- HTS Code input placeholder

- Declared Value input placeholder

- Freight Cost input placeholder

- Unit Count input placeholder

- Country selection placeholder (including icon)

- Input Values: Confirmed entered values display in dark blue (darkNavy: #0A1A3E)

- Results Screen Styling:

- Country name now displays in light blue with 100% opacity

- Other results text (labels, rates) now display in dark blue

- Improved visual hierarchy and brand consistency

### 4. Added "None" Option for Default Country

- Added a "None" option at the top of the country selection list in Settings

- Allows users to clear any previously selected default country

- "None" displays in italic gray text for visual distinction

- When "None" is selected, the Lookup screen won't pre-select any country

- Updated the clear all data function to reset to "None" instead of defaulting to China
