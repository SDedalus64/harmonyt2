UX & Result-Related Enhancements 1. Brand-Color Theming on Lookup Screen
• Placeholder text is now in electricBlue, guiding the eye to where you start typing.
• Input values appear in darkNavy, improving legibility against the background.
• Country names in results are highlighted in electricBlue to help you quickly scan and verify your selection. 2. Automatic Reciprocal Tariff Exemptions
• Instead of forcing users to manually enable exemptions, the system now detects and applies any reciprocal-duty exemptions based on the configured tariff rules—so you instantly see the correct net duty without extra clicks. 3. USMCA Origin Support with a Clear Toggle
• A dedicated “USMCA Certificate” toggle lets you mark CA/MX goods as origin-verified. When turned on, duty-free rates apply automatically, and the UI clearly shows “USMCA” next to the rate. 4. Additive Stacking of Reciprocal Tariffs
• All applicable reciprocal duties now sum together instead of one overwriting another. For example, if two reciprocity rules apply (10% + 5%), you’ll see a combined 15% duty, ensuring transparency in how the final rate is calculated. 5. Tariff Data Revision 14 Roll-Out
• Default global rate updated to 50%, so any items without special rules now default to a clear, uniform duty.
• UK special rate remains at 25%, labeled “UK 25%” so it’s never mistaken for the global rate.
• Section 232 Steel entries explicitly display “50%, UK 25%” to reflect both the general and country-specific rates side by side.
• Extended exemptions are now automatically reflected in results for:
• Pharmaceuticals (Ch. 30) from China
• Medical devices (HS 9018–9022) from China
• Energy products (Ch. 27) from Canada and Mexico

Technical Fixes & Under-the-Hood Improvements 1. Parallel Initialization & Non-blocking Startup
• tariffSearchService and TariffService now kick off at the same time, so a slow autocomplete call won’t block your main tariff lookup. 2. Reduced Timeouts & Timeout Protections
• Search service timeout shortened to 5 seconds to fail fast on network hiccups.
• Guards around initialization routines catch slow operations and log them, avoiding silent hangs. 3. Resolved Context Hook Error
• The app is now wrapped in a top-level <SettingsProvider> so any component using useSettings always has the necessary context. 4. Duty Calculation Logic Corrections
• Updated the calculateDuty function in useTariff.ts to correctly factor in USMCA origin cases, preventing under- or over-charging. 5. Detailed Instrumentation & Logging
• Added timing logs around each service startup and search endpoint call—so you’ll see exactly where delays occur in diagnostics. 6. Removed Reciprocal-Tariff Toggle
• The old “Make Reciprocal Tariffs Additive” switch is gone and the additive logic is now hard-coded, reducing UI clutter and potential user confusion. 7. Version-Controlled Tariff Data
• Tariff payloads are now delivered as datestamped JSON files, giving you full auditability on which tariff set is in use at any point in time.
