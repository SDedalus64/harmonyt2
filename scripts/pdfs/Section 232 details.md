### **How the Section 232 tariff-rate-quotas (TRQs) are set up**

| **Element**             | **How it works**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Quota pool**          | **Country-wide and product-wide**, not importer-specific. Each partner (EU, U K, Japan, etc.) has an annual tonnage limit, further divided into product categories (e.g., flat-rolled, pipe, stainless). CBP treats that tonnage as a **single bucket per category, per quarter**.                                                                                                                   |
| **Importer allocation** | **None.** There is no pre-allotment to individual importers. Entries are accepted **first-come-first-served** until the quarterly category fills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **How CBP tracks fill** | When you file an entry and claim “in-quota” (flag **HTS 9903.80.05 – 9903.80.63** for steel, 9903.85.xx for aluminum), ACE checks the running balance. If tonnage remains, your entry liquidates at **0 % extra duty**. If the balance is exhausted, ACE kicks you to the “over-quota” heading (**9903.80.01** steel, **9903.85.01** aluminum) and charges the 50 % (steel) or 10 % (aluminum) duty. |
| **Quarterly reset**     | Unused quota in a quarter is generally **not rolled over**; the pool resets on the first day of the next quarter. (Some agreements allow limited “spill-over” of up to 4 %.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Documentation**       | CBP issues a **Quota Bulletin (QB)** before each year starts and **Quota Status Reports** during the quarter. Importers and brokers monitor fill at https://www.cbp.gov/trade/quota or via CSMS messages.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### **Bottom-line answers to your questions**

- **Is the quota “per importer”?**

  **No.** It is a single, cumulative quota for **all importers combined** for that partner country and product category.

- **What happens to a single shipment if the quota is nearly full?**

  CBP applies quota on a **first-come basis down to the last kilogram**.
  - If space is available for your entire shipment, you enter at 0 %.
  - If not, ACE prorates: the tonnage that fits under the cap clears at 0 %; the remainder auto-switches to the over-quota heading and pays the 50 % or 10 % duty.

- **Any way to reserve quota?**

  No reservation system exists. Large importers often file entry summaries shortly after sailing or even “entry on arrival” to capture quota before it fills.

So: quotas are **country-level pools**, managed by CBP on a real-time first-come basis; no importer has a dedicated slice.
